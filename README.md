**Using WebScraper:**

To use WebScraper, please follow the instructions below:

1. Extract the file from the `WebScraper.zip` archive to a folder on your computer.
2. Find and double-click the `main.exe` file to launch WebScraper.

**Note:** Upon the first run, your system may display a warning indicating that the application is unrecognized. To proceed, click on 'More info' or a similar option in the system popup, and then choose 'Run anyway' or 'Use it anyway'.

3. In the WebScraper interface, click the 'Select HTML File' button and navigate to the location where you saved the HTML file from the student system. Select the file and open it.
4. Once your HTML file is loaded, click the 'Scrape and Save to Excel' button to start the scraping process.
5. After the process completes, you will find the output CSV file in the same folder where `main.exe` is located. The CSV file contains the scraped course information.
